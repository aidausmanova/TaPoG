    "text": "3 Netflix ESG Report 2022 A letter from our co-CEOs At Netflix, we aspire to entertain the world — and to do so sustainably and responsibly. You can read the full details of how  in our fourth Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance (ESG) Report published today. But we wanted to highlight three areas upfront: First , the environment:  The next decade is critical if we’re to manage climate change sustainably. It’s why Netflix has committed to halving our emissions by 2030. We will do this by optimizing our energy use, then electrifying it and decarbonizing the rest. Second , inclusion:  Netflix is becoming more representative of the members we serve. We now have offices in over 25 countries. Almost half of our employees are women and, in the US, 50% are from historically excluded ethnic and/or racial backgrounds. We’re also seeing increased representation on and off screen — with significantly more female directors and showrunners, and more people of color in leading roles. Third , governance: Our business model is well proven and Netflix is a leader in streaming entertainment in terms of engagement, revenue and profit. So we’re evolving to a more standard large-cap governance structure, including the phased declassification of our board, the elimination of supermajority voting provisions and changes to our executive compensation program from 2023 onwards.",

Over the last 25 years, we’ve worked hard to create long term value for our stakeholders — in particular members, shareholders and the creative community. While we’ve made good progress, there’s still more to do. For example, most of our carbon emissions come from our productions, which require a lot of power — often in remote locations — and are still heavily fossil fuel dependent. But we’re investing in the technology innovations today that can optimize and electrify this energy use tomorrow. We are excited about the great entertainment coming this year — from returning favorites like our Emmy award winning series The Crown  and recently released hit action sequel Extraction  2, starring Chris Hemsworth, to must-watch new films and TV shows such as Heart of Stone , Rebel Moon , Griselda  and 3 Body Problem .

Sustainability Strategy Sustainability in Our Operations and Value Chain Netting Remaining Emissions to Zero Sustainability in Storytelling The science is clear — the next decade is critical  if we are to manage climate change sustainably. In March of 2021, we set two  near-term  climate targets aligned with consensus climate science that can be measured in years, not decades: Our Public Climate Targets Reduce our emissions by roughly half by 2030 ; and   Bring our remaining net emissions from 2022 onwards to zero , in support of global net zero goals, by investing in nature-based solutions that retain and capture carbon .When we first set our emissions targets, we aligned to the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) standard for Scope 3 “supplier engagement” targets5. After working to improve our Scope 3 data, we submitted an upgraded quantitative “intensity” target6 aligned to current SBTi standards for validation in 2022.

We approach these four levers using an OED framework — i.e., first optimizing energy use, then electrifying it and decarbonizing the rest. ● Optimize (O) : We are conducting energy efficiency audits, including for our stages, studios and offices, so we can optimize vehicle fleet operations, right-size vehicles and mobile power and give preference to more efficient equipment. ● Electrify (E): We are working to electrify the equipment that uses the most fuel, like vehicles, buildings and generators. Where available, we use electric motors, which are more efficient and because electricity is more easily decarbonized. We’ve successfully piloted the use of mobile batteries and hydrogen-battery powered generators in lieu of fossil-fuel powered generators in our productions. And we are also replacing fossil-fuel vehicles with electric, plug-in hybrid and hybrid vehicles. ● Decarbonize (D) : When optimization and electrification aren’t possible, we decarbonize the remaining emissions by installing and purchasing renewable energy.",

In 2022, AWS reported via their customer carbon footprint tool  that our carbon footprint was reduced by approximately 98%  compared to last year. This is due to AWS’s renewable energy usage and purchasing, and energy efficiency initiatives. This trend is consistent with research findings, which show that the energy intensity of global data centers has decreased by 20% annually since 2010.

This evaluation looked at a range of climate risks as defined by the Task Force on Climate-Related Disclosures , including physical, regulatory, reputational, market, legal, and transitional risks. We also referenced the ESG-Specific Committee of Sponsoring  Organizations’ (COSO) framework  and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) research to build a climate risk framework to assess Netflix risk.

Regulatory impacts could impose additional costs and limitations on how we produce content and operate our service. Regulatory impacts on traditional energy sources could pose a risk on our license to operate and produce content (e.g., bans on diesel generators in desirable shooting locations) if new comparable technologies aren’t introduced in sufficient supply in time. Time Horizon Short Term Medium Term Mitigation Strategy We produce content all around the world and can be somewhat resilient to issues related to a particular studio or filming location. As part of our planning for productions, we conduct risk assessments and develop detailed emergency response plans for each different potential scenario. During production, we regularly track adverse weather events and other situations that may impact the continuity of our productions and implement plans as needed (e.g., halting production, moving locations, etc.). We will also continue to monitor global physical risks as a part of our enterprise wide risk management and business continuity programs, which will inform additional mitigation strategies.

When an employee donates to a charitable organization (from over 2 million eligible charitable organizations in 200 countries), Netflix matches that with 2X the donation amount, with an upper limit of $20,000 per employee per year  for all donations and matches. This democratizes giving decisions, and incentivizes employees to support causes they’re passionate about. In 2022, we expanded our giving options and ways to get involved. We added a new volunteer match program in which Netflix employees can donate time by volunteering. For every hour an employee volunteers with an eligible cause, Netflix donates $50 to the same cause as part of each employee’s annual match maximum.

We regularly assess what areas of vulnerability there are, how we detect issues, how we respond and then how we let people know.

As such, we have recently evolved to a more standard large-cap governance structure. At our 2022 annual meeting, the Netflix Board proposed and stockholders approved significant changes to our corporate governance structure. We implemented a phased-in declassification of our board, with directors elected at this year’s annual meeting serving one-year terms and the entire board standing for annual elections beginning in 2025 and beyond. We also eliminated supermajority voting provisions in our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation (the “Charter”) and our Amended and Restated Bylaws (the “Bylaws”), provided shareholders with the ability to call special meetings, and adopted a majority voting standard in uncontested director elections. We also adopted a market standard director resignation policy.

Netflix GHG emissions reporting follows the operational control approach set out by the GHGP. Our reported emissions account for all GHGs covered by the UNFCCC Kyoto  Protocol (Annex A)  relevant to Netflix activities and are converted into metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (MTCO2e) as specified by the GHG Protocol. All emission factors are applied to the data and updated annually to reflect the latest guidance and factors published by US EPA Emission Factors for Greenhouse Gas Inventories (2022), US EPA eGRID2021 Electricity Grid Emission Factors (2023) and UK DEFRA Greenhouse Gas Reporting Conversion Factors (2022).

Some of these data sets such as the average building energy use intensity values from the DOE Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey (2016), are held constant to maintain consistency across years.   Netflix’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reporting is consistent with the “operational control” approach as set out by the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard: Revised Edition. The organizational and operational boundary applies to the global company including its subsidiaries, the office and studio facilities we own and operate (e.g., Albuquerque Studios) as well as facilities we lease from others but over which we have meaningful operational control (e.g., corporate and studio offices and stages). OUR FOOTPRINT BOUNDARY Scope 1 and 2: Our emissions include all Scope 1 (direct) and Scope 2 (indirect emissions) from the following: our corporate operations (offices, etc); the production of our films, series and games; and the storage and delivery of our content. Scope 2 emissions are calculated using market-based and location-based emissions accounting methods defined by the GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance.

Scope 3: Netflix also estimates and reports relevant Scope 3 categories, which therefore includes activities outside of our operational control.  Our Scope 3 boundary was established in alignment with the GHG Protocol Corporate and Scope 3 Standards. Netflix includes all relevant and material sources of emissions including categories 1-4, 6-8 and 11. In the future, we aim to include category 5 (emissions related to waste in operations) by improving our direct data collection. For now, most estimated waste-related emissions in our footprint are captured in category 1 (purchased goods & services) using spend-based estimates on facilities management and production operations. Scope 3 emissions use location-based emissions factors except where individual suppliers provided supplier specific emissions that are market-based (e.g., AWS) or through application of RECs to Scope 3 emissions where information on the specific energy consumption by location was available (e.g., for the Open Connect network) in order to match the contractual instrument to known energy consumption in accordance with GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance.",

We include all Netflix-branded content productions, whether we manage the production directly (like The Sea Beast, Spirit Rangers, Don’t Look Up, Our Great National Parks ), or through a third-party production company (like Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery, The Elephant Whisperers ) as well as all content that we license that is Netflix-branded (like Octonauts: Above and Beyond, Captain Nova, Down to Earth with Zac Efron ). Activities outside of our operational control present challenges to measuring and reducing emissions, but because so much of production infrastructure, crew and equipment are shared across studios, we believe that holding ourselves accountable for all emissions from Netflix-branded content (wherever it is produced) will create a positive ripple effect across our own emissions as well as the entire industry. Data Management We maintain a Greenhouse Gas Inventory Management plan to ensure consistency of calculating and estimating emissions from year to year, and to provide to our 3rd party assurance providers as a basis for their audit of our emissions.
